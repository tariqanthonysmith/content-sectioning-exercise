Kaiju (Citation: https://www.wordsense.eu/kaiju/) 
    <p>A giant monster, particularly such as those common to Japanese science fiction films, like Godzilla or Gamera.
Kaiju Cafe was created in 1999 as a half-hatched plan that Erika Lee came up
with while awaiting Y2K. She watched too many monster movies on Sunday
afternoons. Later, she had a child obsessed with large creatures with sharp
teeth, which was fitting. The restaurant originally offered vegetarian and vegan
food. However, many disappointed visitors expected meat to be on the menu. The
internet offers mixed opinions about kaiju diets, but there seems to be some
consensus that there’s a kaiju to eat just about anything. Therefore, burgers
made it on the menu, in addition to big salads and Erika’s famous chocolate
cake.</p>
